What is it?
+++++++++++

Imagine you are working with other people on project and they just don't get the
idea of version control, and you'r tired of explaining. So all these people end
up working via FTP and someone has to pull it together.

Here's an example of your daily "svn status":
?  path/to/foo.txt
!  path/to/bar.txt
M  path/to/foobar.txt

(20 or more, of course!)

svn-manage to the rescue! This script let's you cleanup whatever other people left
behind. It's not meant to really "figure out" what went wrong or how to resolve
conflicts or how to commit the right thing. It's for people who just want to get it
done -- because you can always revert later! :-D

How do you install this? Easy!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) git clone git://github.com/till/svn-manage.git ./svn-manage
2) cd svn-manage
3) [sudo] pear install --all-deps package.xml

This installs svn-manage into one of these paths:

/usr/local/bin/svn-manage
/usr/bin/svn-manage
/bin/svn-image

---

How do you use it?
++++++++++++++++++

1) Simple:
svn-manage -t /local/path/to/your/repo

2) With username/password (for SVN):
svn-manage -u till -p -t /local/path/to/your/repo

That's all, kiddos! Email me if you have feedback!
